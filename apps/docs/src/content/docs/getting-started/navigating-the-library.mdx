_This page adapts the original AI SDK documentation: [Navigating the Library](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/getting-started/navigating-the-library). It reflects the Swift AI SDK packages and environments._

The Swift AI SDK is a powerful toolkit for building AI applications in Swift. This page will help you pick the right tools for your requirements.

Let’s start with a quick overview. In the TypeScript docs the SDK is presented as three parts; in Swift we focus on the Core equivalent:

- **Swift AI SDK Core (SwiftAISDK):** A unified API for generating text, structured objects, and tool calls with LLMs in Swift.

> Note: UI libraries (AI SDK UI, RSC) are JavaScript-only and do not apply to the Swift AI SDK.

## Choosing the Right Tool for Your Environment

When deciding which part of the Swift AI SDK to use, your first consideration should be the environment and existing stack you are working with.

| Library (Swift)        | Purpose                                                                                                       | Environment Compatibility                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Swift AI SDK Core      | Call LLMs with unified API (e.g. generateText/streamText, tools, structured output)                           | iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, server-side Swift     |

## Environment Compatibility

These tools have been designed to work together. Pick based on your environment and stack:

The following table outlines AI SDK compatibility based on environment:

| Environment                      | Swift AI SDK Core |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| iOS / iPadOS / macOS apps        | ✓                 |
| Server-side Swift (e.g., Vapor)  | ✓                 |
| watchOS / tvOS                   | ✓                 |
| JavaScript runtimes (Node/Deno)  | ✗                 |

## When to use Swift AI SDK

Use the Swift AI SDK when building AI features in Swift apps or servers. It offers:

- Streaming and non‑streaming text generation
- Structured outputs and tool calling
- Provider‑agnostic model access (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, OpenAI‑compatible)

## UI Libraries (JS‑only)

> Note: React/Vue/Svelte hooks (AI SDK UI) are not part of the Swift AI SDK. If you need UI hooks, use the TypeScript SDK within a JS frontend.

## RSC (JS‑only)

> Note: AI SDK RSC (React Server Components utilities) is JavaScript‑specific and not included in the Swift AI SDK.
