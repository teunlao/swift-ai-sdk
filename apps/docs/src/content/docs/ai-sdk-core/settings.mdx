# Settings

Large language models (LLMs) typically provide settings to augment their output.

All AI SDK functions support the following common settings in addition to the model, the [prompt](./prompts), and additional provider-specific settings:

```swift highlight="3-9"
import SwiftAISDK
import OpenAIProvider

let result = try await generateText(
  model: openai("gpt-4.1"),
  settings: CallSettings(
    maxOutputTokens: 512,
    temperature: 0.3,
    maxRetries: 5
  ),
  prompt: "Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions."
)
```

> Note
> Some providers do not support every common setting. Unsupported values generate entries in `result.warnings`. Always inspect warnings when you depend on a particular capability.

### `maxOutputTokens`

Maximum number of tokens to generate.

### `temperature`

Temperature setting.

The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model. For most providers, `0` means almost deterministic results, and higher values mean more randomness.

It is recommended to set either `temperature` or `topP`, but not both.

> Note
> In AI SDK 5.0, temperature is no longer set to `0` by default.

### `topP`

Nucleus sampling.

The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model. For most providers, nucleus sampling is a number between 0 and 1.
For example, 0.1 means only tokens with the top 10% probability mass are considered.

It is recommended to set either `temperature` or `topP`, but not both.

### `topK`

Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

Used to remove "long tail" low-probability responses.
Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use `temperature`.

### `presencePenalty`

The presence penalty affects the likelihood of the model to repeat information that is already in the prompt.

The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.
For most providers, `0` means no penalty.

### `frequencyPenalty`

The frequency penalty affects the likelihood of the model to repeatedly use the same words or phrases.

The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.
For most providers, `0` means no penalty.

### `stopSequences`

The stop sequences to use for stopping the text generation.

If set, the model will stop generating text when one of the stop sequences is generated.
Providers may have limits on the number of stop sequences.

```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import OpenAIProvider

let result = try await generateText(
  model: openai("gpt-4.1"),
  settings: CallSettings(stopSequences: ["END", "DONE"]),
  prompt: "Produce a three-step checklist that ends with DONE."
)
```

### `seed`

The seed (integer) to use for random sampling.
If set and supported by the model, calls will generate deterministic results.

### `maxRetries`

Maximum number of retries. Set to 0 to disable retries. Default: `2`.

### `abortSignal`

An optional cancellation check that can be used to cancel the call.

For example, you can forward UI cancellation or implement a timeout.

#### Example: Timeout

```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import OpenAIProvider

let deadline = Date().addingTimeInterval(5)

let result = try await generateText(
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  prompt: "Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.",
  settings: CallSettings(
    abortSignal: { Date() >= deadline }
  )
)
```

### `headers`

Additional HTTP headers to be sent with the request. Only applicable for HTTP-based providers.

You can use request headers to provide additional information to the provider,
depending on what the provider supports. For example, some observability providers support
headers such as `Prompt-Id`.

```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import OpenAIProvider

let result = try await generateText(
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  prompt: "Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.",
  settings: CallSettings(headers: [
    "Prompt-Id": "my-prompt-id"
  ])
)
```

> Note
> The `headers` setting is for request-specific headers. You can also configure default headers when constructing a provider; those headers are sent with every request.
