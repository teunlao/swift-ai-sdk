_This page adapts the original AI SDK documentation: [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/mcp-tools)._ 

> Warning
> The MCP tools feature is experimental and may change in the future.

The AI SDK supports connecting to [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers to access their tools.
This enables your AI applications to discover and use tools across various services through a standardized interface.

## Initializing an MCP Client

The Swift AI SDK currently ships with an HTTP-based SSE transport. Use it for production deployments. If you need a different execution environment, provide a custom type that conforms to `MCPTransport`.

Create an MCP client using one of the following transport options:

- **SSE transport (Recommended)**: Uses `SseMCPTransport` to connect to an MCP server over HTTP(S)
- **Custom transport**: Implement `MCPTransport` for specialised requirements (for example an internal proxy)

### SSE Transport (Recommended)

```swift
import SwiftAISDK

let client = try await createMCPClient(
  config: MCPClientConfig(
    transport: .config(MCPTransportConfig(
      type: "sse",                         // only "sse" is supported by the built-in factory
      url: "https://your-server.com/mcp",
      headers: ["Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"]
    ))
  )
)
```

### Custom Transport

You can also bring your own transport by implementing the `MCPTransport` interface for requirements not covered by the standard transport.

```swift
import SwiftAISDK

final class MyTransport: MCPTransport {
  var onclose: (() -> Void)?
  var onerror: ((Error) -> Void)?
  var onmessage: ((JSONRPCMessage) -> Void)?

  func start() async throws {
    // open connection
  }

  func send(message: JSONRPCMessage) async throws {
    // forward JSON-RPC message to the server
  }

  func close() async throws {
    // close connection
  }
}

let client = try await createMCPClient(
  config: MCPClientConfig(transport: .custom(MyTransport()))
)
```

> Note
> The client returned by `createMCPClient` is a lightweight adapter intended for tool conversion. It currently does not include every feature of the full MCP spec (authorization, session management, resumable streams, notifications, etc.).

### Closing the MCP Client

After initialization, you should close the MCP client based on your usage pattern:

- For short-lived usage (e.g., single requests), close the client when the response is finished
- For long-running clients (e.g., command line apps), keep the client open but ensure it's closed when the application terminates

When streaming responses, you can close the client when the LLM response has finished. For example, when using `streamText`, provide an `onFinish` callback that closes the client after the final step:

```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import OpenAIProvider

let client = try await createMCPClient(
  config: MCPClientConfig(transport: .config(MCPTransportConfig(url: "https://your-server.com/mcp")))
)

let tools = try await client.tools(options: nil)

let stream = try streamText(
  model: openai("gpt-4.1"),
  tools: tools,
  prompt: "What is the weather in Brooklyn, New York?",
  onFinish: { _ in
    Task { try? await client.close() }
  }
)

for try await delta in stream.textStream {
  print(delta, terminator: "")
}
```

When generating responses without streaming, you can use `defer` (or another cleanup mechanism) to close the client:

```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import OpenAIProvider

let client = try await createMCPClient(
  config: MCPClientConfig(transport: .config(MCPTransportConfig(url: "https://your-server.com/mcp")))
)
defer { Task { try? await client.close() } }

let output = try await generateText(
  model: openai("gpt-4.1"),
  tools: try await client.tools(options: nil),
  prompt: "Describe the current Brooklyn weather in one sentence."
)
print(output.text)
```

## Using MCP Tools

The client's `tools` method acts as an adapter between MCP tools and AI SDK tools. It supports two approaches for working with tool schemas:

### Schema Discovery

With schema discovery, all tools offered by the server are automatically listed, and input parameter types are inferred based on the schemas provided by the server:

```swift
import SwiftAISDK

let tools = try await client.tools(options: nil) // same as automatic discovery
```

This approach is simple to implement and automatically stays in sync with server changes. However, you will not have compile-time type information for inputs, and every tool exposed by the server becomes available to the model.

### Schema Definition

For better type safety and control, you can define the tools and their input schemas explicitly in your client code:

```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import AISDKProviderUtils

let getDataSchema = FlexibleSchema(
  jsonSchema(
    .object([
      "type": .string("object"),
      "properties": .object([
        "query": .object([
          "type": .string("string"),
          "description": .string("The data query")
        ]),
        "format": .object([
          "type": .string("string"),
          "enum": .array([.string("json"), .string("text")])
        ])
      ]),
      "required": .array([.string("query")])
    ])
  )
)

let emptyArgsSchema = FlexibleSchema(
  jsonSchema(.object([
    "type": .string("object"),
    "properties": .object([:])
  ]))
)

let tools = try await client.tools(options: MCPToolsOptions(
  schemas: .schemas([
    "get-data": ToolSchemaDefinition(inputSchema: getDataSchema),
    "tool-with-no-args": ToolSchemaDefinition(inputSchema: emptyArgsSchema)
  ])
))
```

This approach gives you explicit control over tool interfaces and enables stronger validation: the schemas you provide are enforced at runtime, and only the tools you enumerate are retrieved from the server.

## Examples

You can see MCP tools in action in the following example:
