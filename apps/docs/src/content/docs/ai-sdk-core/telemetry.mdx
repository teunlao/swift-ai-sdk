description: Using OpenTelemetry with AI SDK Core

_This page adapts the original AI SDK documentation: [Telemetry](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/telemetry)._

:::caution
AI SDK Telemetry is experimental and may change in the future.
:::

The AI SDK uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to collect telemetry data.
OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to provide
standardized instrumentation for collecting telemetry data.

## Enabling telemetry

You can use the `experimentalTelemetry` parameter to enable telemetry on specific function calls while the feature is experimental:

```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import OpenAIProvider

let result = try await generateText(
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  prompt: "Write a short story about a cat.",
  experimentalTelemetry: TelemetrySettings(isEnabled: true)
)
```

When telemetry is enabled, you can also control if you want to record the input values and the output values for the function.
By default, both are enabled. You can disable them by setting the `recordInputs` and `recordOutputs` options to `false`.

Disabling the recording of inputs and outputs can be useful for privacy, data transfer, and performance reasons.
You might for example want to disable recording inputs if they contain sensitive information.

```swift
let result = try await generateText(
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  prompt: "Sensitive user data...",
  experimentalTelemetry: TelemetrySettings(
    isEnabled: true,
    recordInputs: false,
    recordOutputs: false
  )
)
```

## Telemetry Metadata

You can provide a `functionId` to identify the function that the telemetry data is for,
and `metadata` to include additional information in the telemetry data.

```swift
let result = try await generateText(
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  prompt: "Write a short story about a cat.",
  experimentalTelemetry: TelemetrySettings(
    isEnabled: true,
    functionId: "my-awesome-function",
    metadata: [
      "something": "custom",
      "someOtherThing": "other-value"
    ]
  )
)
```
