description: Learn about the providers and model families that ship with the Swift AI SDK.
---

_This page adapts the original AI SDK documentation: [Providers and Models](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/providers-and-models)._ 

Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Groq offer access to families of large language models (LLMs) through distinct APIs. Each API has its own authentication story, request/response schema, streaming protocol, and feature gates—making it hard to switch providers without rewriting application code.

The Swift AI SDK mirrors the AI SDK language-model specification (`AISDKProvider`). Every provider module implements the same typed surface area, so calls like `generateText`, `generateObject`, and the streaming helpers stay identical even when you swap vendors.

## Swift AI SDK provider modules

The Swift port currently ships with the following provider packages. Each module exports a lazily configured global shortcut plus a factory for advanced configuration, matching the TypeScript behavior.

- [OpenAI Provider](/providers/openai) — `import OpenAIProvider`, then call `openai("gpt-4o")` or `createOpenAIProvider(settings:)`.
- [Anthropic Provider](/providers/anthropic) — `import AnthropicProvider`, use `anthropic("claude-3-5-sonnet")` or `createAnthropicProvider(settings:)`.
- [Google Generative AI Provider](/providers/google-generative-ai) — `import GoogleProvider`, use `google("gemini-1.5-pro")` or `createGoogleGenerativeAI(settings:)`.
- Groq Provider — `import GroqProvider`, use `groq("llama-3.1-8b-instant")` or `createGroqProvider(settings:)`. _(Documentation coming soon)_
- OpenAI Compatible Provider — `import OpenAICompatibleProvider`, call `createOpenAICompatibleProvider(settings:)` for any OpenAI-compatible gateway. _(Documentation coming soon)_

Each shortcut performs lazy API-key loading (via environment variables such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`) and returns a ready-to-use `LanguageModelV3` instance for the higher-level Swift AI SDK APIs.

## Self-hosted and upstream-compatible APIs

If you are integrating with a custom gateway that implements the OpenAI API surface (for example LM Studio or Together.ai), use the OpenAI Compatible provider. Override the base URL, API key, and optional headers in `OpenAICompatibleProviderSettings` and the rest of your Swift code stays identical.

The TypeScript AI SDK community also maintains dozens of additional providers (Amazon Bedrock, Mistral, Cohere, DeepSeek, and more). These have not yet been ported to Swift; visit the upstream documentation for details and to track parity:

## Model capabilities overview

| Provider | Typical model identifiers | Text | Embeddings | Images | Audio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI (`openai`) | `gpt-5`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4o-audio-preview` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Anthropic (`anthropic`) | `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `claude-3-opus` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Google Generative AI (`google`) | `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Groq (`groq`) | `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `mixtral-8x7b-32768` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (transcription) |
| OpenAI-compatible (`createOpenAICompatibleProvider`) | Depends on upstream service | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

> Model catalogs evolve quickly. Inspect the individual provider modules (`Sources/OpenAIProvider`, `Sources/AnthropicProvider`, `Sources/GoogleProvider`, `Sources/GroqProvider`, and `Sources/OpenAICompatibleProvider`) for authoritative `ModelId` helpers and supported feature sets.

By standardizing provider integrations behind the Swift AI SDK interfaces you can experiment with multiple vendors, fail over between services, or mix models in the same application without rewriting business logic.
