Swift AI SDK helps you build AI‑powered apps in Swift with a single, provider‑agnostic API.

What you get
- One API across providers for text, structured data, and tools.
- Streaming outputs and usage metrics.
- Strong typing with Codable schemas (and optional Zod adapter).
- Composable middleware and provider registry.

Core concepts (one‑liners)
- Model — an LLM you call (e.g. OpenAI‑compatible).
- Prompt — input message(s) and optional system instructions.
- Response — text or structured object, with token usage.
- Tools — functions the model can call to fetch data or take actions.
- Stream — real‑time token/events feed during generation.

Quick start
```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import AISDKProvider

let model = OpenAICompatible.TextModel(
  id: "gpt-4o-mini",
  baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.openai.com/v1")!,
  apiKey: ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ?? ""
)

let r = try await generateText(model: model, input: "Say hi in one sentence")
print(r.text)
```

Next steps
- Generating & Streaming Text → `/core/generating-text`
- Structured data (objects) → `/core/generate-object`
- Tool calling → `/core/tools`
- Providers & models → `/providers`
