description: Learn how to use Vercel's v0 models with the AI SDK.
---

_This page adapts the original AI SDK documentation: [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/content/providers/01-ai-sdk-providers/02-vercel.mdx)._

The [Vercel](https://vercel.com) provider gives you access to the [v0 API](https://v0.app/docs/api/model), designed for building modern web applications. The v0 models support text and image inputs and provide fast streaming responses.

You can create your Vercel API key at [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/chat/settings/keys).

> Note: The v0 API is currently in beta and requires a Premium or Team plan
> with usage-based billing enabled. For details, visit the v0.dev pricing page.
> To request a higher limit, contact Vercel at support@v0.dev.

## Features

- **Framework aware completions**: Evaluated on modern stacks like Next.js and Vercel
- **Auto-fix**: Identifies and corrects common coding issues during generation
- **Quick edit**: Streams inline edits as they're available
- **Multimodal**: Supports both text and image inputs

## Setup

The Vercel provider is available in the `VercelProvider` module. Add it to your Swift package:

```swift
// Package.swift (excerpt)
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/teunlao/swift-ai-sdk", from: "0.14.0")
],
targets: [
  .target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
      .product(name: "SwiftAISDK", package: "swift-ai-sdk"),
      .product(name: "VercelProvider", package: "swift-ai-sdk")
    ]
  )
]
```

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `vercel` from `VercelProvider`:

```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import VercelProvider

let model = vercel("v0-1.5-md")
```

If you need a customized setup, you can use `createVercel` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```swift
import VercelProvider

let vercel = createVercel(settings: VercelProviderSettings(
  apiKey: ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["VERCEL_API_KEY"],
  baseURL: "https://api.v0.dev/v1",
  headers: ["X-Custom-Header": "value"]
))
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Vercel provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls. The default prefix is `https://api.v0.dev/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to
  the `VERCEL_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom fetch implementation (middleware) for testing or request interception.

## Language Models

You can create language models using a provider instance. The first argument is the model ID, for example:

```swift
import SwiftAISDK
import VercelProvider

let result = try await generateText(
  model: vercel("v0-1.5-md"),
  prompt: "Create a Next.js AI chatbot"
)

print(result.text)
```

Vercel language models can also be used in `streamText` (see [Generating & Streaming Text](/ai-sdk-core/generating-text)).

## Models

### v0-1.5-md

The `v0-1.5-md` model is for everyday tasks and UI generation.

### v0-1.5-lg

The `v0-1.5-lg` model is for advanced thinking or reasoning.

### v0-1.0-md (legacy)

The `v0-1.0-md` model is the legacy model served by the v0 API.

All v0 models have the following capabilities:

- Supports text and image inputs (multimodal)
- Supports function/tool calls
- Streaming responses with low latency
- Optimized for frontend and full-stack web development
