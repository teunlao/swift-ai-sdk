# Validation Request — Example Feature

> **THIS IS AN EXAMPLE** - Copy this template when creating real validation requests

**Executor**: executor-name
**Date**: 2025-10-12T18:00:00Z
**Priority**: HIGH
**Related**: N/A

---

## Context

Implemented the `delay()` function from `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` with full async/await support and Task cancellation. This is a simple utility that pauses execution for a specified time.

**Upstream**: Vercel AI SDK v6.0.0-beta.42 (commit `77db222ee`)
**Block**: Block B (Provider Utils)

---

## Files to Validate

### Implementation
- `Sources/SwiftAISDK/ProviderUtils/Delay.swift` - Async delay function with cancellation

### Tests
- `Tests/SwiftAISDKTests/ProviderUtils/DelayTests.swift` - 8 test cases

### Upstream References
- `external/vercel-ai-sdk/packages/provider-utils/src/delay.ts`
- `external/vercel-ai-sdk/packages/provider-utils/src/delay.test.ts`

## Implementation Summary

**Lines of code**: ~45 lines (implementation + tests ~120 lines)
**New functions**: 1 public (`delay(_ delayInMs: Int?) async throws`)
**Adaptations**:
- Promise → async throws
- AbortSignal → Task.checkCancellation()
- setTimeout → Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)

**Key decisions**:
1. Used `Task.sleep` for delay implementation (Swift standard)
2. `nil` delay resolves immediately (matches upstream)
3. Negative delays treated as 0 (defensive programming)
4. `CancellationError` thrown on Task cancellation

## Pre-Validation Checklist

Executor confirms:
- [x] All public APIs from upstream implemented (1/1)
- [x] All upstream tests ported (8/8 tests)
- [x] Build passes: `swift build` (0.85s, no warnings)
- [x] Tests pass: `swift test` (242/242 passing)
- [x] Upstream references in file headers
- [x] Adaptations documented in code
- [x] No regressions in existing tests

**Test Results**:
```
✔ Test run with 242 tests passed after 0.042 seconds.
```

---

## Questions for Validator

1. Is the Task.checkCancellation() approach correct for Swift async cancellation?
2. Should we add more edge case tests (e.g., Int.max delay)?

---

## Expected Validation Scope

Please verify:
- [x] API parity (function signature matches)
- [x] Behavior parity (nil, negative, cancellation handled correctly)
- [x] Test coverage (all 8 upstream cases ported)
- [x] Code quality (clean, idiomatic Swift)
- [x] Adaptations (Promise→async documented)

**Ready for validation**: ✅ YES
