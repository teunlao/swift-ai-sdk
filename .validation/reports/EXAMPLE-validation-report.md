# Validation Report ‚Äî Example Feature

> **THIS IS AN EXAMPLE** - Real validation reports will follow this format

**Validator**: validator/claude-sonnet-4.5
**Date**: 2025-10-12T18:05:00Z
**Status**: ‚úÖ APPROVED

---

## Executive Summary

The `delay()` function implementation achieves **100% upstream parity** with excellent Swift adaptations. All 8 test cases ported correctly, tests passing, and code quality is high. Ready for merge.

---

## Files Validated

### Implementation
- ‚úÖ `Sources/SwiftAISDK/ProviderUtils/Delay.swift` (45 lines)

### Tests
- ‚úÖ `Tests/SwiftAISDKTests/ProviderUtils/DelayTests.swift` (120 lines, 8 tests)

### Upstream
- ‚úÖ `external/vercel-ai-sdk/packages/provider-utils/src/delay.ts`
- ‚úÖ `external/vercel-ai-sdk/packages/provider-utils/src/delay.test.ts`

---

## API Parity

### Function Signatures: ‚úÖ 100% (1/1)

| TypeScript | Swift | Match |
|------------|-------|-------|
| `async function delay(delayInMs?: number): Promise<void>` | `func delay(_ delayInMs: Int?) async throws` | ‚úÖ |

**Analysis**:
- Parameter types match (optional number/Int)
- Return type correctly adapted (Promise<void> ‚Üí async throws)
- Function name identical
- Async pattern properly converted

### Type Definitions: ‚úÖ N/A (no custom types)

---

## Behavior Parity

### Core Functionality: ‚úÖ 100% (5/5 scenarios)

| Scenario | TypeScript | Swift | Match |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Normal delay | Resolves after time | Completes after time | ‚úÖ |
| Nil/undefined delay | Resolves immediately | Returns immediately | ‚úÖ |
| Zero delay | Resolves immediately | Returns immediately | ‚úÖ |
| Negative delay | Treated as 0 | Treated as 0 | ‚úÖ |
| Cancellation | AbortSignal | Task.checkCancellation | ‚úÖ |

**Edge Cases Verified**:
- ‚úÖ `nil` delay ‚Üí immediate return
- ‚úÖ `0` delay ‚Üí immediate return
- ‚úÖ Negative delay ‚Üí treated as 0
- ‚úÖ Task cancellation ‚Üí throws CancellationError
- ‚úÖ Large delays (smoke test)

**Adaptations (all justified)**:
- `Promise<void>` ‚Üí `async throws` ‚úÖ Standard Swift async
- `AbortSignal` ‚Üí `Task.checkCancellation()` ‚úÖ Swift cancellation model
- `setTimeout` ‚Üí `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)` ‚úÖ Swift Foundation API

## Test Coverage

### Test Files: ‚úÖ 100% (1/1 ported)

| Upstream | Swift | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `delay.test.ts` | `DelayTests.swift` | ‚úÖ Ported |

### Test Cases: ‚úÖ 100% (8/8 ported)

| Test Case | Upstream | Swift | Match |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| Resolves after specified time | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Resolves immediately when nil | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Resolves immediately when 0 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Handles negative delays | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Throws on cancellation | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Throws immediately if cancelled | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Multiple concurrent delays | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Large delays (smoke) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

### Test Execution: ‚úÖ PASSING

```bash
$ swift test
‚úî Test run with 242 tests passed after 0.042 seconds.
```

**No regressions**: All existing 234 tests still passing.

## Code Quality

### Upstream References: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT

```swift
/**
 Port of `@ai-sdk/provider-utils/src/delay.ts`.

 Delays execution for a specified time.
 ...
 */
```

‚úÖ Clear upstream reference in file header
‚úÖ Adaptation rationale documented

### Documentation: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT

- Function docstring with examples
- Parameter descriptions
- Throws documentation
- Usage examples provided

### Swift Idioms: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT

- Proper use of `async throws`
- Task cancellation handled correctly
- Sendable compliance considered
- Clean, readable code

## Issues Found

### None üéâ

No issues found. Implementation is exemplary.

---

## Recommendations

### [INFO] üîµ Optional Improvements

None required. Implementation is production-ready.

**Optional enhancements** (not blocking):
1. Could add documentation for `Int.max` delay behavior (currently smoke tested)
2. Could add performance benchmarks (not in upstream either)

---

## Verdict

‚úÖ **APPROVED FOR MERGE**

**Summary**:
- API Parity: **100%** ‚úÖ
- Behavior Parity: **100%** ‚úÖ
- Test Coverage: **100%** (8/8 tests) ‚úÖ
- Code Quality: **Excellent** ‚úÖ
- Documentation: **Excellent** ‚úÖ

**Blockers**: None
**Action Items**: None
**Ready**: ‚úÖ Yes

## Answers to Executor Questions

> 1. Is the Task.checkCancellation() approach correct for Swift async cancellation?

‚úÖ **Yes, absolutely correct.** This is the idiomatic Swift approach for cooperative cancellation in async tasks. The implementation properly checks cancellation before and during sleep.

> 2. Should we add more edge case tests (e.g., Int.max delay)?

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Optional, not required.** Current test coverage matches upstream (8/8 tests). The smoke test for large delays is sufficient. Adding Int.max test would be a Swift-specific enhancement but not necessary for parity.
