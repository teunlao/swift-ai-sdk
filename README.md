# Swift AI SDK

Unofficial Swift port of the Vercel AI SDK v2. This repository starts as a clean Swift Package Manager project; implementation will be built from scratch with reference to the upstream TypeScript sources kept under `external/` (git-ignored).

## Structure
- `Package.swift` – SwiftPM manifest.
- `Sources/SwiftAISDK` – library target placeholder.
- `Tests/SwiftAISDKTests` – initial test target.
- `external/` – checked-out Vercel AI SDK sources (ignored by Git) for reference during the port.

## Status
Initial scaffold only. Implementation work not yet started.
